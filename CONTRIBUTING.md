## Tips for bug reports

* Always completely fill out the issue template that is automatically inserted
  on issue creation.
* You can obtain much better error messages with `ranger --debug`, please post
  those in bug reports rather than the usual, single-line error message. Also
  check the log by using the default map `W` or by running the command `display_log`.
* Send security-relevant bugs PGP-encrypted to hut@hut.pm, see `HACKING.md`.

## Tips on patching

* See `HACKING.md`

Thank you!
